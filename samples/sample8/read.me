Sample 8 is sample for DDE-access. Therefore there are two programms:
client.exe and server.exe     

To test the DDE samples:

1. Build server.exe and client.exe with your favourit compiler
2. start the server (server.exe)
3. start one or more clients (client.exe)
4. fill out one ore more entry-fields in the server-window.
   When you fill out an entry-field and this field lose the focus (e.g. use 
   <TAB> the entry-field of the client(s) are updated.
